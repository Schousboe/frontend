          Welcome to <strong>Voxel Earth</strong>, a cutting-edge 3D Tiles pipeline that brings real-world
          photogrammetry data—like Google’s 3D Tiles—directly into Minecraft. Our goal is to let anyone
          explore famous landmarks, entire cityscapes, and even planetary bodies, all converted on the

      <h2>Welcome to Voxel Earth</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Voxel Earth</strong> automates the process of converting 3D Tiles (like those from
        Google Earth or Cesium) into fully explorable Minecraft worlds. By joining
        our server at <code>play.voxelearth.org</code>, you can see iconic places worldwide
        re-created with voxel blocks in real time.
      </p>

      <h3>Our Origins</h3>
      <p>
        Since the early days of Minecraft modding, people have dreamed of a "real Earth"
        you can explore block by block. Initially, many players tried building iconic
        landmarks by hand—an immense task. With <strong>Voxel Earth</strong>, we fully automate
        that process using advanced voxelization algorithms and a GPU pipeline that
        handles even the largest photogrammetry data sets.
      </p>

      <h3>Why “Voxel Earth”?</h3>
      <blockquote>"Putting the planet in your (Minecraft) hands."</blockquote>
      <p>
        We focus on the simple joy of exploring your favorite real-world locations in a
        beloved game. From traversing city streets to climbing famous structures, you
        get the experience of a lifetime. Voxel Earth brings the entire globe to you—
        right inside Minecraft.
      </p>
